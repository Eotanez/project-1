The question we addressed:
Do financial markets in countries with lower per-capita deaths perform better financially vs. countries with higher per-capita deaths? 
(as measured by prices being stable and not dropping)

Data for our project was found from:

Major world financial market indices downloaded as csv files from http://investing.com.

Currency API from http://exchangeratesapi.io was used to download historical currency rates as json.

Covid data from the WHO was downloaded from http://ourworldindata.org/coronavirius in a csv file.
